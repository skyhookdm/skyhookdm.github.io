SkyhookDM is an open source project to enable automatic mapping of data processing of structured data to heterogeneous architectures by providing a framework for efficient and composable data processing in storage and networking layers. SkyhookDM leverages Apache Arrow and other open source projects that receive significant investment by the data management community in science and industry. The project strives to maximize contributions to existing open source projects while minimizing the size (and need for maintenance) of an independent codebase.

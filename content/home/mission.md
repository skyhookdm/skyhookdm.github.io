Cultivate an ecosystem in which the open source software for the computational I/O stack can be developed, distributed, and sustained. This open source software must reduce barriers of adoption and meet the current and future challenges of the computational I/O stack, and the solutions should leverage the existing expertise outside storage and network I/O communities.

## Goals

- Foster collaboration around the open source data science, storage, and networking systems ecosystem
- Support the development with system- and domain-specific computational I/O stack packages
- Reduce barriers of adoption of open source software for the computational I/O stack

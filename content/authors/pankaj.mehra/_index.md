**Contemplating a new Compute-Memory Hierarchy through the lens of an Acceleration Programming Interface**

**Abstract:** Simple enough to describe in one sentence, the theory of operation of XPI, an interface that targets acceleration starting to show up in and near memory and storage devices, revolves around three core concepts. First, an infrastructure abstraction that uniformizes disaggregated infrastructure. Second, a new abstraction for comprehending an application's data spanning the full richness of modern memory and storage systems. Third, an abstraction capable of supporting the offloading of interdependent parallel computations with set-valued dependencies. The talk is motivated through the upcoming upheaval of memory hierarchy in data centers and concludes with a call to action for industry and academia participants alike.

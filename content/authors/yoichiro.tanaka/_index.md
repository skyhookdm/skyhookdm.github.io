# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Yoichiro Tanaka is a professor in Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC) at Tohoku University. He received Bachelor and Master degrees in Communications Engineering and a Ph.D degree in Electronic Engineering from Tohoku University, where he did his thesis research on perpendicular magnetic recording physics and storage systems integrations. He had worked in Toshiba’s storage device business and in academia over 30 years. He was devoted to the validation and development of PMR and achieved the realization of the world’s first PMR HDD in 2005. His career includes the development of giant magnetoresistive heads, perpendicular granular thin film media, and recently a new computational storage system with integrated bigdata analytics capability.

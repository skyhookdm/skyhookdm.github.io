# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Yoichiro Tanaka is a professor in Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC) at Tohoku University. He received the Bachelor, the Master degrees in Communications Engineering and the Ph.D degree in Electronic Engineering from Tohoku University, where he did his thesis research on perpendicular megnetic recording physics and the storage system integrations. He had worked in Toshiba’s storage device business and in academia over 30 years. He devoted to the proof and development of PMR and achieved the realization of the world’s first PMR HDD in 2005. His carrier includes the development of a giant magnetoresistive head, the perpendicular glanular thin film media, and recently a new computational storage systems with integrated bigdata analytics capability.

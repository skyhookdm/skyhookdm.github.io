**Kinetic Open Storage Project Update**

**Abstract:** Prior to departing Seagate I was able to open source the remaining components of Seagate's Kinetic implementation, namely their server kineticd.  This server implementation was used in their production 4T and 8T production offerings.  An entire Kinetic research vehicle in source form is available for research, from client to server.  This presentation will go over this open source.

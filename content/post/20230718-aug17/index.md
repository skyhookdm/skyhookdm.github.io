ðŸ‘‹ Join us for an exciting event featuring IEEE Distinguished Lecturer {{% mention yoichiro.tanaka %}} (Tohoku University) discussing technological and institutional innovations to make the computational I/O stack a reality!

The [IEEE Magnetics Society's Distinguished Lecturers Program](https://ieeemagnetics.org/membership/educational-outreach/distinguished-lecturers), the Skyhook Data Management community with funding by the National Science Foundation ([TI-2229773](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2229773)), the Center for Research in Open Source Software ([cross.ucsc.edu](https://cross.ucsc.edu)), and the Open Source Program Office, UC Santa Cruz ([ospo.ucsc.edu](https://ospo.ucsc.edu)) will convene a one-day workshop on August 17, 2023, 10am-3pm, at UC Santa Cruz, Engineering 2 (room to be confirmed). 

The introduction of computational data management services into the I/O stack, especially in storage and networking devices requires both technological innovations and new relations between university and industry. This workshop convenes storage systems, open source, and community architecture experts to discuss technologies and strategies for a computational I/O stack with low market entry barriers.

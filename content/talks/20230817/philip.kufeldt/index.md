Prior to departing Seagate I was able to open source the remaining components of Seagate's Kinetic implementation, namely their server, kineticd.  This kinetic server implementation was used inside their production 4T and 8T Kinetic HDD offerings.  An entire Kinetic research vehicle in source form is now available for research, from client to server.  This presentation will go over this open source.

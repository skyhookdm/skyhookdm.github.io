We solicit papers describing original work relevant to reproducibility and independent verification of scientific results. And not published or under review elsewhere. ACM REP is a single-blind reviewed conference. Therefore, authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page. ACM REP submissions can be either research papers, surveys, vision, and experience papers. 

### Research Papers (Long and Short)

We solicit both full length papers (10 pages) and short papers (4 pages). The former tend to be descriptions of complete technical work, while the latter tend to be descriptions of interesting, innovative ideas, which nevertheless require more work to mature. The program committee may decide to accept some full papers as short papers. Full papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference, while short papers will be presented in the form of posters. All papers regardless of size, will be given an entry in the conference proceedings. The requested page limit is without references. Authors may optionally include reproducibility information that allows for automated validation of experimental results (see artifact evaluation criteria) Accepted submissions passing automated validation will earn the ACM Reproducibility badges in accordance with the artifact review and validation policy.

### Artifact Evaluation Criteria

The conference will also be soliciting code/data artifacts. For submitted papers, these artifacts will be optional supplemental material and solicited based on the PC criteria. The artifacts will be mandatory for accepted full papers with experimental results. The artifacts will be reviewed by an Artifact Evaluation committee, and those that pass will be awarded [Reproducibility Badges](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current) per ACM policy.

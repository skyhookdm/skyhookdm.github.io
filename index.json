For cost-effective high bandwidth, many data centers have used tiered storage with warmer tiers made of flashes and cooler tiers provisioned with high-density rotational disk drives. While recent advances in storage media, high-speed interconnects, and systems software have greatly improved modern platforms’ ability to handle massive data, highly selective data retrievals, such as those in the form of SQL-like queries with predicates on potentially multiple data columns, tend to still experience excessive delays when unordered, unindexed data written in log-structured formats for high write bandwidth is subsequently read for interactive data analytics. Queries run slowly because an entire dataset may have to be transferred from storage to worker nodes, even when only a small portion is actually relevant. In the worst case, significant delays are experienced even when data is read from warm storage. A user sees even higher delays when data must be streamed from cool storage tiers.\nIn this presentation, we present C2, a research collaboration between Seagate and Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) for the lab’s next-generation campaign storage. Campaign is a scalable cool storage tier at LANL managed by MarFS that currently provides 100 PBs of storage space for long-term data storage. Cost-effective data protection is done through multi-level erasure coding at both node level and rack level. To prevent users from potentially having to read back an entire dataset, C2 enables direct SQL-like query processing at the storage level by leveraging Seagate Kinetic Computational Storage Drives for near data processing. Combining computational storage technologies with erasure coding based data protection schemes for rapid data analytics over cool storage presents unique challenges in which individual disk drives may not be able to see complete data records and may not deliver performance required by high-level data applications. We discuss those challenges in the talk, share our designs, and report early results. Our results show that computational storage shows higher performance when host-storage interconnection bandwidth is a bottleneck, when host CPU is a bottleneck, and, perhaps surprisingly, when hosts do not have any obvious bottlenecks.\nBio: Qing Zheng is a Scientist in Los Alamos National Lab’s High-Performance Computing Division and a member of the Lab’s Ultrascale System Research Center.

A huge amount of data is being stored, processed, transmitted, and then shared via large scale networked datacenters which consist of millions of data storage systems filled with perpendicular magnetic recording (PMR) hard disk drives. The PMR technology was invented by Shunichi Iwasaki in 1975 and the first commercial product was launched in 2005. Since then, the data storage has become the ever-growing foundation of the digital world and led the data-driven innovations such as bigdata AI analytics, internet of things, medical science, and even a blackhole visualization in astronomy.\nThis lecture will provide the essential magnetics to create innovative data storage technology of PMR and the origin of the high-density recording performance which has led current recording density growth. The storage performance stands on the stacked system foundation and the building blocks are, from the base, physics of magnetics, 3D material controls of sub-nanometer in size, magnetic and electronic device design, storage device integration, and storage system architectures together with non-volatile memories to unleash the intrinsic performance. The development of new storage devices and the system requires a multi-scale approach and a right guiding principle to establish expected functions. As an extension of PMR research, the lecture will also show the prospect of future storage technology and the system architecture from the multi-scale view of the storage system development. A new computational storage system aiming at unifying computation power on data store and brain-inspired system considerations as well as the academism-industry relations to realize those systems will also be introduced.\nBio: Yoichiro Tanaka is a professor in Research Institute of Electrical Communication (RIEC) at Tohoku University.

However, an optimal, static partitioning is likely to change whenever workload characteristics shift, for varying device characteristics, and for evolving characteristics of the storage system.\nA storage system grows when new, heterogeneous storage devices are added to the storage hierarchy. As characteristics of these devices evolve and they gain more compute resources, it will be desirable (and necessary) to deploy heterogeneous data processing and storage engines that are well designed for device-specific characteristics or data-specific modeling and storage. I call a storage system designed for this complexity a computational storage system (CS system).\nWe are working towards dynamic, just-in-time partitioning of computation to utilize the extra compute resources available in a CS system. In this talk, I will describe how we approach just-in-time partitioning of computation by decomposing a logical query plan (initial query plan) into portions (subplans) that can be distributed. On any given CS device, a subplan is processed locally, translated to a physical query plan, then the physical query plan is executed. Execution of the physical query plan may be partial (best-effort), and the portions that were not executed are propagated with the query results so that CS devices higher in the data access path may, collectively, eventually complete execution of the initial query plan.\n","date":1692144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1692144e3,"objectID":"2a9946ea928194f8594d73158066feac","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/talks/20230817/aldrin.montana/","publishdate":"2023-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/20230817/aldrin.montana/","section":"talks","summary":"Existing research in computational storage primarily explores pushdown of a single query operator or its supporting functions from a database management system.

ATSE is a traditional HPC software stack for testbed systems. As a full-featured stack, it is able to provide complex I/O libraries such as HDF5, NetCDF, CGNS, Exodus, and others.

To perform analysis and compute on this data, it must first be transported to compute servers, usually with big DRAMs and huge processing capabilities, where the data is processed and result sets sent to the client. Traditional data transport frameworks use TCP/IP as their underlying protocol and therefore require the users to provide with a single contiguous buffer for transfer to the framework. We observe that this approach adds a severe overhead when transferring batches of columnar records. Columnar tables consist of several buffers scattered in the memory, each representing a particular column and its metadata. Serializing these buffers into a single buffer requires doing multiple memory copies. To avoid this serialization overhead while transfer columnar batches over the wire, we propose using RDMA as a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we explore transporting columnar result sets over RDMA from a server to a client and compare this approach with a state-of-the-art TCP/IP based transport framework.

For cost-effective high bandwidth, many data centers have used tiered storage with warmer tiers made of flashes and cooler tiers provisioned with high-density rotational disk drives. While recent advances in storage media, high-speed interconnects, and systems software have greatly improved modern platforms’ ability to handle massive data, highly selective data retrievals, such as those in the form of SQL-like queries with predicates on potentially multiple data columns, tend to still experience excessive delays when unordered, unindexed data written in log-structured formats for high write bandwidth is subsequently read for interactive data analytics. Queries run slowly because an entire dataset may have to be transferred from storage to worker nodes, even when only a small portion is actually relevant. In the worst case, significant delays are experienced even when data is read from warm storage. A user sees even higher delays when data must be streamed from cool storage tiers.\nIn this presentation, we present C2, a research collaboration between Seagate and Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) for the lab’s next-generation campaign storage. Campaign is a scalable cool storage tier at LANL managed by MarFS that currently provides 100 PBs of storage space for long-term data storage. Cost-effective data protection is done through multi-level erasure coding at both node level and rack level. To prevent users from potentially having to read back an entire dataset, C2 enables direct SQL-like query processing at the storage level by leveraging Seagate Kinetic Computational Storage Drives for near data processing. Combining computational storage technologies with erasure coding based data protection schemes for rapid data analytics over cool storage presents unique challenges in which individual disk drives may not be able to see complete data records and may not deliver performance required by high-level data applications. We discuss those challenges in the talk, share our designs, and report early results. Our results show that computational storage shows higher performance when host-storage interconnection bandwidth is a bottleneck, when host CPU is a bottleneck, and, perhaps surprisingly, when hosts do not have any obvious bottlenecks.\n","date":1689552e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1689552e3,"objectID":"2a058d8de3151c76b81207c2e1bfb9e8","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/talks/20230817/qing.zheng/","publishdate":"2023-07-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/20230817/qing.zheng/","section":"talks","summary":"High-performance computing data centers supporting large-scale simulation applications can routinely generate a tremendous amount of data.

However, with the advent of networks supporting 25-100 Gb/s and storage devices delivering 1,000,000 reqs/sec, the CPU has become the bottleneck trying to keep up feeding data in and out of these fast devices. The result is that data access libraries executed on single clients are often CPU-bound and cannot utilize the scale-out benefits of distributed storage systems. One attractive solution to this problem is to offload data-reducing processing and filtering tasks to the storage layer. However, modifying legacy storage systems to support compute offloading is often tedious and requires an extensive understanding of the system internals. Previous approaches re-implemented functionality of data processing frameworks and access libraries for a particular storage system, a duplication of effort that might have to be repeated for different storage systems.  This paper introduces a new design paradigm that allows extending programmable object storage systems to embed existing, widely used data processing frameworks and access libraries into the storage layer with no modifications. In this approach, data processing frameworks and access libraries can evolve independently from storage systems while leveraging distributed storage systems' scale-out and availability properties. We present Skyhook, an example implementation of our design paradigm using Ceph, Apache Arrow, and Parquet. We provide a brief performance evaluation of Skyhook and discuss key results.","tags":["papers","programmable","storage","systems","arrow","nsf1836650","nsf1705021","nsf1764102"],"title":"Skyhook: Towards an Arrow-Native Storage System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jayjeet Chakraborty","Carlos Maltzahn","David Li","Tom Drabas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1643587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1688515200,"objectID":"c05a2dfe467c799ab0607b586ff94793","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/chakraborty-arrowblog-22/","publishdate":"2022-05-08T18:22:08.329823Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chakraborty-arrowblog-22/","section":"publication","summary":"CPUs, memory, storage, and network bandwidth get better every year, but increasingly, they’re improving in different dimensions. Processors are faster, but their memory bandwidth hasn’t kept up; meanwhile, cloud computing has led to storage being separated from applications across a network link. This divergent evolution means we need to rethink where and when we perform computation to best make use of the resources available to us.\nFor example, when querying a dataset on a storage system like Ceph or Amazon S3, all the work of filtering data gets done by the client. Data has to be transferred over the network, and then the client has to spend precious CPU cycles decoding it, only to throw it away in the end due to a filter. While formats like Apache Parquet enable some optimizations, fundamentally, the responsibility is all on the client. Meanwhile, even though the storage system has its own compute capabilities, it’s relegated to just serving “dumb bytes”.\nThanks to the [Center for Research in Open Source Software](https://cross.ucsc.edu) (CROSS) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Apache Arrow 7.0.0 includes Skyhook, an [Arrow Datasets](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/dataset.html) extension that solves this problem by using the storage layer to reduce client resource utilization.

To benefit our community, we open-source our work and show that consuming data through Apache Arrow is zero-cost: our novel data interface is either on-par or more performant than native Spark.","tags":["papers","spark","arrow","performance","nsf1836650"],"title":"Zero-Cost, Arrow-Enabled Data Interface for Apache Spark","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Aaron Chu","Jeff LeFevre","Carlos Maltzahn","Aldrin Montana","Peter Alvaro","Dana Robinson","Quincey Koziol"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"fea189160dee93ce7424cc48371e9981","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/chu-epjconf-20/","publishdate":"2021-02-21T00:24:01.226701Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chu-epjconf-20/","section":"publication","summary":"Access libraries such as ROOT and HDF5 allow users to interact with datasets using high level abstractions, like coordinate systems and associated slicing operations. Unfortunately, the implementations of access libraries are based on outdated assumptions about storage systems interfaces and are generally unable to fully benefit from modern fast storage devices. For example, access libraries often implement buffering and data layout that assume that large, single-threaded sequential access patterns are causing less overall latency than small parallel random access: while this is true for spinning media, it is not true for flash media. The situation is getting worse with rapidly evolving storage devices such as non-volatile memory and ever larger datasets. Our Skyhook Dataset Mapping project explores distributed dataset mapping infrastructures that can integrate and scale out existing access libraries using Ceph's extensible object model, avoiding reimplementation or even modifications of these access libraries as much as possible. These programmable storage extensions coupled with our distributed dataset mapping techniques enable: 1) access library operations to be offloaded to storage system servers, 2) the independent evolution of access libraries and storage systems and 3) fully leveraging of the existing load balancing, elasticity, and failure management of distributed storage systems like Ceph. They also create more opportunities to conduct storage server-local optimizations specific to storage servers. For example, storage servers might include local key/value stores combined with chunk stores that require different optimizations than a local file system. As storage servers evolve to support new storage devices like non-volatile memory, these server-local optimizations can be implemented while minimizing disruptions to applications. We will report progress on the means by which distributed dataset mapping can be abstracted over particular access libraries, including access libraries for ROOT data, and how we address some of the challenges revolving around data partitioning and composability of access operations.","tags":["papers","programmable","declarative","objectstorage","nsf1836650"],"title":"Mapping Scientific Datasets to Programmable Storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeff LeFevre","Carlos Maltzahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"865e411be877820cdabae9f09315eb30","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/lefevre-snia-20/","publishdate":"2023-01-26T14:23:16.862545Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lefevre-snia-20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["programmable","storage"],"title":"SkyhookDM: Storage and Management of Tabular Data in Ceph","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianshen Liu","Matthew Leon Curry","Carlos Maltzahn","Philip Kufeldt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"f7340b531adf3e2f68f81ac006cc8e75","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/liu-hotedge-20/","publishdate":"2020-04-19T19:42:33.148866Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-hotedge-20/","section":"publication","summary":"In the resource-rich environment of data centers most failures can quickly failover to redundant resources. In contrast, failure in edge infrastructures with limited resources might require maintenance personnel to drive to the location in order to fix the problem. The operational cost of these 'truck rolls' to locations at the edge infrastructure competes with the operational cost incurred by extra space and power needed for redundant resources at the edge. Computational storage devices with network interfaces can act as network-attached storage servers and offer a new design point for storage systems at the edge. In this paper we hypothesize that a system consisting of a larger number of such small 'embedded' storage nodes provides higher availability due to a larger number of failure domains while also saving operational cost in terms of space and power. As evidence for our hypothesis, we compared the possibility of data loss between two different types of storage systems: one is constructed with general-purpose servers, and the other one is constructed with embedded storage nodes. Our results show that the storage system constructed with general-purpose servers has 7 to 20 times higher risk of losing data over the storage system constructed with embedded storage devices. We also compare the two alternatives in terms of power and space using the Media-Based Working Unit (MBWU) that we developed in an earlier paper as a reference point.","tags":["papers","edge","reliability","disaggregation","embedded","failures"],"title":"Scale-out Edge Storage Systems with Embedded Storage Nodes to Get Better Availability and Cost-Efficiency At the Same Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeff LeFevre","Carlos Maltzahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":159192e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":159192e4,"objectID":"915e552d840309dc5886f66457e45fc1","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/lefevre-login-20/","publishdate":"2020-06-13T01:39:15.018368Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lefevre-login-20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["papers","programmable","storage","ceph","physicaldesign"],"title":"SkyhookDM: Data Processing in Ceph with Programmable Storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeff LeFevre","Carlos Maltzahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580515200,"objectID":"c0997a47ffd719cd2ea0c0d4f82ae9a9","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/lefevre-vault-20/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T06:43:50.391599Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lefevre-vault-20/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["shortpapers","programmable","storage","physicaldesign"],"title":"Scaling databases and file APIs with programmable Ceph object storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kathryn Dahlgren","Jeff LeFevre","Ashay Shirwadkar","Ken Iizawa","Aldrin Montana","Peter Alvaro","Carlos Maltzahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572566400,"objectID":"e615944dd1d3f72bced85e81bb5a0490","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/dahlgren-pdsw-19/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T06:43:50.411373Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dahlgren-pdsw-19/","section":"publication","summary":"In the post-Moore era, systems and devices with new architectures will arrive at a rapid rate with significant impacts on the software stack. Applications will not be able to fully benefit from new architectures unless they can delegate adapting to new devices in lower layers of the stack. In this paper we introduce physical design management which deals with the problem of identifying and executing transformations on physical designs of stored data, i.e. how data is mapped to storage abstractions like files, objects, or blocks, in order to improve performance. Physical design is traditionally placed with applications, access libraries, and databases, using hard- wired assumptions about underlying storage systems. Yet, storage systems increasingly not only contain multiple kinds of storage devices with vastly different performance profiles but also move data among those storage devices, thereby changing the benefit of a particular physical design. We advocate placing physical design management in storage, identify interesting research challenges, provide a brief description of a prototype implementation in Ceph, and discuss the results of initial experiments at scale that are replicable using Cloudlab. These experiments show performance and resource utilization trade-offs associated with choosing different physical designs and choosing to transform between physical designs.","tags":["papers","programmable","storage","datamanagement","physicaldesign"],"title":"Towards Physical Design Management in Storage Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jeff LeFevre","Noah Watkins","Michael Sevilla","Carlos Maltzahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"a06d72e4b291d58378ac21f0662aef77","permalink":"https://skyhookdm.github.io/publication/lefevre-vault-19/","publishdate":"2020-01-05T06:43:50.416084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lefevre-vault-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Ceph is an open source distributed storage system that is object-based and massively scalable.

These interfaces are powerful for application developers and can be created in C, C++, and Lua.\nSkyhook is an open source storage and database project in the Center for Research in Open Source Software at UC Santa Cruz. Skyhook uses these capabilities in Ceph to create specialized read/write interfaces that leverage IO and CPU within the storage layer toward database processing and management. Specifically, we develop methods to apply predicates locally as well as additional metadata and indexing capabilities using Ceph's internal indexing mechanism built on top of RocksDB.\nSkyhook's approach helps to enable scale-out of a single node database system by scaling out the storage layer.
